                <p>My mission is to keep having fun with code while learning to get better at it. Whether it be structuring another page of HTML, or styling a page with new CSS knowledge, or tinkering with Javascript to help page functionality, I want to keep on improving my skills day in and day out</p>

                <h3>Some of my Interests and Favorites</h3>
                <h4>Video Games is one of my favorite things to do. <small>Valorant is my favorites!</small></h4>
                <p class="d-none d-sm-block">Valorant is a team-based first person tactical hero shooter than has many different fun Agents to play.</p>
                <h4>Sports is another hobby I have always loved. <small>My sport was ice hockey!</small></h4>
                <p class="d-none d-sm-block">Although I played many sports, my favorite sport by far was ice hockey. I played competitively for a travel team and always really enjoyed feeling the cool breeze while I was on the ice.</p>
                <h4>Another interst I have is music. <small>Music is an amazing thing all around.</small></h4>
                <p class="d-none d-sm-block">I love just listening to different types of music depending on what I am doing or what mood I am in. I also used to play the violin and paino when I was younger and played around on the drums, playing along with other friends, when I was a young adult.</p>
                <h4>Another interest of mine has always been building things. <small>Whether its electronics, puzzles, or Legos, I have always enjoyed building things!</small></h4>
                <p class="d-none d-sm-block">I have always been a Lego fan since I was younger and liked to solder small simple kits to make sirens and other things. I also built my own computer a few years ago!</p>
